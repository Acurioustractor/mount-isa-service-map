## 🔥 **How to Scale to 100+ Services**

### **Option 1: Upgrade Firecrawl Plan** (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# With paid plan ($20/month):
# - 1000 requests/hour vs 100/hour free
# - Can process all 25 major websites
# - Expected: 200-500 services discovered

node comprehensive-firecrawl-research.js
```

**Expected Results with Paid Plan:**
- 🏛️ **Government**: 50+ services (councils, departments, agencies)
- 🏥 **Health**: 40+ services (hospitals, clinics, mental health)
- 🏘️ **Community**: 60+ services (Salvation Army, Red Cross, etc.)
- ♿ **Disability**: 30+ services (NDIS providers, support services)
- 🎓 **Education**: 25+ services (schools, training, youth programs)
- 👴 **Aged Care**: 20+ services (home care, respite, aged housing)
- ⚖️ **Legal**: 15+ services (legal aid, advocacy, court support)

### **Option 2: Continue with Free Tier** (Slower but Free)
```bash
# Run batch system daily:
# - 3-5 services per run
# - 15-20 services per week
# - 60-80 services per month

node batch-research.js
```

### **Option 3: Alternative Data Sources**
```bash
# Government open data
# Business directories
# Community organization APIs
# Social media scraping (Facebook, etc.)
```

---

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **1. Run Batch System Daily**
```bash
# Add to cron for automated daily discovery
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/mount-isa && node batch-research.js

# This will discover 3-5 services per day
# Reaching 50+ services within 2 weeks
```

### **2. Expand Target URLs**
The current batch system can be expanded with more Mount Isa specific URLs:

```javascript
// Add to batch-research.js:
{
    name: "Indigenous Services",
    urls: [
        'https://www.qaihc.com.au',
        'https://www.niaa.gov.au', 
        'https://kalkadoon.org.au'
    ]
},
{
    name: "Employment & Training",
    urls: [
        'https://www.jobsqueensland.gov.au',
        'https://www.tafe.qld.edu.au',
        'https://www.jobactive.gov.au'
    ]
}
```

### **3. Manual High-Value Additions**
Some services may need manual addition due to complex websites:
- Mount Isa Mines community programs
- Mining company family services
- Local churches and religious organizations
- Sports clubs and recreational groups
