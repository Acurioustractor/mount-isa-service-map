## 🚀 How to Run Research & Store Records

### **Option 1: Firecrawl (RECOMMENDED)**

**Why Firecrawl is better:**
- ❌ No search engine blocking
- ✅ AI-powered service extraction
- ✅ Comprehensive site crawling
- ✅ Finds hidden services on official websites

```bash
# 1. Get Firecrawl API key from https://firecrawl.dev
# 2. Set environment variable
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# 3. Run comprehensive research
node firecrawl-research-runner.js
```

**Research Areas:**
- Government sites (mountisa.qld.gov.au, qld.gov.au)
- Health services (health.qld.gov.au/north-west)
- Community organizations (salvationarmy.org.au, redcross.org.au)
- Disability services (ndis.gov.au)
- Education & Youth (pcyc.org.au)

### **Option 2: Simple Demo Runner**

```bash
# Run basic research demo (works now)
python3 research-demo.py

# Run simplified web research (may get blocked)
python3 simple-research-runner.py
```

### **Option 3: Full AI Research System**

```bash
# Start the comprehensive system (needs dependencies fixed)
cd scraping-system
pip install asyncpg redis elasticsearch
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Then use API endpoints:
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/research/discover/all
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/research/discover/health
```

## 📊 Database Storage

### **Your Services Table Enhanced**
Your database now has these research fields:
- ✅ `data_source` - tracks how service was discovered
- ✅ `confidence_score` - AI quality assessment (0.0-1.0)
- ✅ `research_metadata` - extraction details
- ✅ `discovery_date` - when service was found

### **Check Discovered Services**
```sql
-- View discovered services
SELECT name, phone, confidence_score, data_source, discovery_date 
FROM services 
WHERE data_source = 'intelligent_research' 
ORDER BY confidence_score DESC;

-- Count by discovery method
SELECT data_source, COUNT(*) 
FROM services 
GROUP BY data_source;
```

## 🎯 Why Things Got Blocked & Firecrawl Solution

### **Blocking Issues:**
1. **Google/Bing** - Detect automated searches
2. **Rate Limiting** - Too many requests too fast  
3. **Bot Detection** - User-agent patterns
4. **CAPTCHA** - Human verification required

### **Firecrawl Advantages:**
1. **Official APIs** - No scraping detection
2. **AI Extraction** - Finds services in complex pages
3. **Rate Limited** - Built-in respectful crawling
4. **Structured Output** - Clean JSON data
5. **Site Mapping** - Discovers all relevant pages
