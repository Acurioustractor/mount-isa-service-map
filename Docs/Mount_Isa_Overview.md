Great. I will begin a deep research report on the Mount Isa community, focusing on recent discussions (from the past 12 months) about available services, pressing issues, systemic challenges, and opportunities for improvement. I’ll explore government reports, grassroots voices, local media, and social channels to capture a broad, grounded picture.

This will include an overview of:

* Available services (health, disability, youth justice/support)
* Emerging or ongoing challenges and gaps
* Government and community recommendations for action
* Innovative models from Australia and globally
* Recommendations on conducting a regional service audit
* Community engagement approaches and ethical interviewing practices
* Storytelling formats: quotes, photos, videos, case studies

The results will be delivered as a combination of a written report, structured database, and visual storytelling guide.


# Mount Isa Community Services and Needs: A Comprehensive Review

## Overview of Services in Mount Isa (Health, Disability, Youth Support)

**Health Services:** Mount Isa is the regional hub for health in north-west Queensland, but its infrastructure and workforce are stretched. The **Mount Isa Hospital**, built \~60 years ago, is aging and in need of replacement. Despite this, it remains the main referral hospital for the North West Hospital and Health Service (NWHHS). A chronic doctor shortage means heavy reliance on locum staff. To fill gaps, innovative solutions like telehealth clinics (e.g. for physiotherapy) are being trialed. Primary care is bolstered by **Gidgee Healing**, an Aboriginal Community-Controlled Health Service providing holistic care across Mount Isa and Lower Gulf communities. Mental health support for youth is available through **headspace Mount Isa** (free counselling, AOD support, sexual health services for ages 12–25) and a Child and Youth Mental Health Service at the hospital. Notably, a new dedicated mental health facility is planned in Mount Isa (on the old Buffs Club site) to address the region’s **high rate of self-harm and suicide (nearly twice the state average)**. This underscores the urgent need for improved local mental health infrastructure and services.

**Disability Support:** Like many remote areas, Mount Isa faces challenges in disability services – from limited specialist providers to workforce shortages in therapy and allied health. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is active here, with several local and fly-in providers, but community feedback highlights access difficulties (e.g. travel for specialist care). In response, advocacy groups have increased their presence. In mid-2025 a **new peer-led support group** for people with disability was launched by QDN, creating a safe space for locals to connect, share experiences, and voice issues. The Queensland government has also directed funding to inclusive projects in the region – for example, the 2025–26 state budget set aside **\$4 million to upgrade the Mount Isa Diversionary Centre** to include a dedicated women’s facility. This will provide a culturally appropriate refuge and “rest and recovery” service, often used as a sobering-up shelter, aiming to divert vulnerable women (many Indigenous) from custody and connect them to support. Such investments signal recognition of the unique needs of people with disabilities and complex needs in Mount Isa’s community.

**Youth and Family Services:** Mount Isa has a robust network of youth support and justice programs, run by both government and non-government organizations. A Queensland Government **Youth Justice Service Centre** operates in town to supervise young people on court orders and coordinate interventions. Critically, these efforts are complemented by community-based initiatives. The **North West Queensland Indigenous Catholic Social Services (NWQICSS)** runs the local **Community Justice Group**, engaging Indigenous Elders to support at-risk youth and advise courts. NWQICSS also operates a well-regarded **Youth Transitional Hub** in Mount Isa – a safe drop-in space offering case management, cultural activities, education support (including distance schooling) and after-hours services for high-risk youth. This Youth Hub works closely with police, even stationing staff at the watch-house after hours to assist families and help young offenders meet bail conditions (preventing unnecessary detention). For recreation and early intervention, the **Police-Citizens Youth Club (PCYC Mount Isa)** is a cornerstone – it delivered 133 youth programs in 2022 with support from Mount Isa Mines (Glencore). These range from life-skills and fitness initiatives (*Blue EDGE* mentoring, *Love Bites* respectful relationships education) to diversionary programs like *Project Booyah* for teens at risk. PCYC also provides everyday activities (sports, a gym) and an Outside School Hours Care service, giving young people positive outlets. Housing and homelessness services for youth are another critical piece: **Queensland Youth Services (QYS)** runs a Youth Shelter and a **Youth Housing and Reintegration Service (YHARS)** in Mount Isa, helping homeless or transitioning teens with accommodation and life skills. Education and training support is available through alternative schooling (Mount Isa Flexible Learning Centre) and programs like *Skilling Queenslanders for Work* and the **Youth Skills** initiative (which in 2025–26 is funding training specifically for 15–24 year olds engaged with youth justice). In summary, the community’s support ecosystem spans prevention, crisis intervention, and rehabilitation – though coordination among these services is an ongoing effort (as noted later, stakeholders see room to streamline collaborations).

## Key Issues & Challenges Highlighted in the Past Year

**Youth Crime and Justice Pressures:** Over the last 12 months, youth crime has dominated local headlines and discussions. The outback mining town has seen *rising youth offending*, prompting both tough political debate and innovative community responses. In February 2024, a Queensland Parliamentary Committee held a public hearing in Mount Isa as part of an inquiry into youth justice reforms – and locals did not hold back their frustration. Long-term residents and Indigenous leaders criticized such inquiries for *“delivering no value”* and failing to listen to those most affected. *“Youth crime is a major issue for the Aboriginal community — why didn’t they hear from families out here…They didn’t speak to one young person from our community,”* Traditional Owner Roslyn Von Senden told ABC News. She and others observed that the hearing was poorly advertised and structured in a fly-in-fly-out manner, which meant many grassroots voices went unheard. *“Don’t fly in and fly out and think you’re going to solve problems,”* added Corina James, noting the irony that many services in Mount Isa are similarly fly-in professionals who keep 9–5 hours and aren’t present when issues flare up at night. These community voices underscore a core complexity: **solutions must be community-led and consistently present** – a challenge when specialist staff and decision-makers often rotate in from elsewhere.

However, Mount Isa is also seeing proactive strategies to tackle youth crime **before** it escalates. In late 2023 the state piloted a new multi-agency initiative called the **Early Action Group (EAG)** in Mount Isa, modeled on programs in Townsville and Cairns. This team, which includes police, Youth Justice, Child Safety, Education, Health, Housing and Indigenous liaison officers, identifies children as young as 8 who are on the fringes of offending – e.g. chronic truants, kids out late at night, siblings of known offenders. Instead of waiting for crimes to occur, the EAG can intervene early: police and youth co-responders refer at-risk kids for intensive case management. With parental consent, a team of EAG caseworkers assesses the child’s **full environment** – family circumstances, health (e.g. undiagnosed hearing issues), housing stability, schooling options – to tailor support. *“We have a wide scope to tap into all the support agencies in town…to break down the barriers stopping the child from becoming successful,”* explains Senior Sergeant Adrian Rieck, a veteran Mount Isa officer seconded to coordinate the EAG. By mid-2024, the EAG had already worked with around 20 children and their families, demonstrating the demand for such early intervention. This preventive approach is seen as an opportunity to address root causes (like family support or health needs) instead of cycling kids through courts. It aligns with other programs like the **Youth Co-Responder Team**, where police and youth workers patrol together at night to engage young people and divert them from high-risk activities. According to the local Police Superintendent, these holistic early interventions – along with the efforts of PCYC and community initiatives – are yielding results. In fact, Mount Isa’s crime statistics have recently **improved**: in FY 2024–25, the city recorded its first reduction in assaults in six years, a 35% drop in stolen vehicles, and 36% fewer burglaries. While youth crime remains a concern, these figures suggest integrated prevention programs are starting to make a dent. The challenge ahead is scaling and sustaining them, and ensuring *community voices* continue to shape their design.

**Health and Wellbeing Gaps:** Being a remote region, Mount Isa struggles with healthcare access and certain social determinants of health. One prominent issue is the **aging health infrastructure** – the Mount Isa Hospital’s condition not only limits care (with some critical cases sent 900km to Townsville) but also hampers staff recruitment. NWHHS Chief Executive Sean Birgan noted that getting a new hospital in Mount Isa is his biggest challenge, though realistically a decade-long project given funding hurdles. In the meantime, the state has been investing in smaller capital works across the North West: a new primary health care centre on Mornington Island, a mental health unit in Doomadgee, and staff housing in outlying towns, to attract and retain healthcare workers. Workforce is a perennial issue – many posts (GPs, specialists, therapists) remain vacant, leading to short-term rotations and burnout of existing staff. For residents, this can mean long waits or expensive travel for treatment. **Mental health** is a particularly acute area of need: as mentioned, suicide rates are nearly double the state average here, reflecting stressors like unemployment, substance abuse, and intergenerational trauma in some communities. Service providers and advocates have called for more community-based mental health support for youth and men. In one creative example, a local group started a men’s yoga program to help address mental health in a culturally sensitive way, aiming to fill gaps in traditional services. Another enduring health concern is environmental: Mount Isa’s legacy as a mining city means **lead exposure** is an ongoing public health issue, particularly for children. (Blood lead levels are monitored and programs exist to educate families on reducing household dust exposure.) Overall, the health complexities in Mount Isa demand multi-faceted solutions – from infrastructure upgrades to preventive public health initiatives – and greater investment in **locally-delivered care** to overcome the tyranny of distance.

**Housing & Social Issues:** A lack of affordable housing has emerged as a crisis affecting many groups in Mount Isa. Despite being a resource-rich town, Mount Isa has a very tight housing supply – and paradoxically, over 100 homes sit **abandoned** or derelict. In January 2024, ABC News reported at least *117 properties* in the city had been deserted (owing years of rates), even as hundreds of families languish on social housing waitlists. These eyesores not only drag down neighboring property values but represent badly-needed accommodation going unused. Local realtors and welfare groups are **urging authorities to act** – calling for neglected houses to be seized or repaired to ease the housing shortage. *“When you look at the housing shortage…and then these volumes of abandoned houses – it’s a huge issue,”* said agent John Tully, who wants Council and the State to incentivize builders to revive such properties. The Mount Isa City Council’s own Housing Action Plan (2023) identified a need for **at least 550 more dwellings**, nearly half of those for social housing. Currently, crisis accommodation is **beyond capacity** – *“Our crisis accommodation program is operating at full capacity…Families are in need rather than just individuals, so three-bedroom houses are in high demand,”* reported Paula Washington of Centacare North Queensland, which runs local homelessness services. Indeed, the local women’s refuge often has *no vacancies* for domestic violence victims seeking safety. This housing strain intersects with other social issues: overcrowding can exacerbate health problems and family stress, while lack of stable housing undermines efforts to keep youth in school or offenders on bail (if there’s nowhere suitable for them to live). The pending closure of Glencore’s copper mine in 2025 looms as both a challenge and an opportunity in this space – it may temporarily free up private rentals as workers leave, but it also threatens economic hardship and job losses. The community is cognizant that a diversified economy is needed to maintain population and attract investment in housing and services.

**Other Community Concerns:** Residents have also voiced frustration about the high **cost of living** in this remote city. Basic goods and groceries are expensive (a 2020 inquiry noted exorbitant food prices in outback stores, with little improvement since). Likewise, the cost of travel is prohibitive – flights from Mount Isa to Queensland’s east coast can run into the thousands, yet a federal inquiry into regional airfares brought no relief. These factors contribute to isolation: some families struggle to send kids for specialist medical care or even to attend funerals due to travel costs. Additionally, alcohol abuse and related violence remain underlying issues. At a local Crime Prevention Forum in 2024, leaders pointed out public drinking and alcohol-fueled incidents as drivers of both crime and social dysfunction. The Mayor has been working with the Mount Isa Liquor Accord on possible restrictions or programs to *“help with those issues”*, acknowledging that **alcohol is a community-wide challenge** beyond just policing. Grassroots initiatives like the **Murri Men’s and Women’s Groups** (supported by NWQICSS) address domestic violence and substance abuse through cultural healing and early intervention, but they continually seek more support. In summary, Mount Isa’s challenges are **complex and intertwined** – economic change, cost of living, housing, health, crime – reinforcing that any regional plan must take a holistic, collaborative approach.

## Recent Initiatives and Community Voices Shaping the Future

Despite the difficulties, the past year has seen several **opportunities and forward-looking initiatives** for Mount Isa. One major effort has been the creation of the **Mount Isa Future Ready Economy Roadmap**, a partnership between Mount Isa City Council and The Next Economy (an NGO), slated for release in early 2025. Through 2024, this project convened stakeholders across industry, government, and community to envision a diversified, resilient future for Mount Isa. In workshops, locals highlighted that the region is facing *“growing challenges, from mass job losses to regional connectivity to access to childcare and health services”* – but also that the community is eager to harness emerging opportunities. Mayor Peta MacRae emphasized that this Roadmap *“unites the voices of the community, industry, and government”* to address current challenges and *“improve social wellbeing”* alongside the economy. In practice, that meant the process wasn’t just about mining and energy projects; it also included First Nations representatives and service providers. For example, Centacare’s local manager, Michelle Paulsen, participated and noted that changes in the economy (like the mine closure or growth of renewables) directly affect demand for social services – *“sharing what we are witnessing on the ground, and engaging in new ideas helps us better support Mount Isa families”*. Her reflections show a growing recognition that **economic development and community wellbeing go hand in hand**. The Roadmap is expected to outline practical steps not only for diversifying industries (critical minerals, renewable energy, tourism), but also for strengthening liveability – e.g. retaining skilled workers through better housing and services, improving digital connectivity, and investing in local skills.

On the government front, there have been **policy responses** targeting the issues above. The Queensland Government unveiled a new **Community Safety Plan** in 2024, which includes tougher bail laws for serious repeat young offenders, but also expanded prevention programs. Mount Isa was chosen as the site of the first **“Intensive On-Country”** youth rehabilitation trial under this plan. Backed by \$24 million, this program is delivered by a local Indigenous organization (Mithangkaya Nguli / Young People Ahead) and takes young offenders out bush on country. Over several weeks, participants will experience intensive cultural mentoring, bush living, family reconnection, and skills training – essentially a circuit-breaker from negative influences in town. The goal is to reduce reoffending by grounding youths in culture, community, and responsibility. Both the Premier and Youth Justice Minister visited Mount Isa to launch the initiative, saying it was designed *“to ensure First Nations Queenslanders receive rehabilitation support in a culturally appropriate way”* and would *“provide wraparound supports to young people and their families – dealing with mental and physical health, substance misuse, \[and even] their relationship with social media”*. This holistic ethos echoes what local advocates have long been asking for – a move away from fly-in/fly-out, one-size-fits-all programs toward those **built on cultural strengths and local knowledge**. Early feedback from community leaders on On-Country has been positive, though they stress it’s “not a silver bullet” and must be coupled with improved basic services (education, housing, rehab) back in town. The State has also funded additional youth justice resources in Mount Isa, including appointing an extra **Children’s Court magistrate** to hold more hearings locally and avoid delays. Local leaders like Mayor MacRae have lobbied for a **juvenile remand center or rehabilitation facility** to be based in Mount Isa – noting that currently young people who are detained are sent far away to Townsville. She has begun working with experts (such as former Corrections boss Keith Hamburger) on what a “community-powered” model could look like before pressing ahead. The sentiment is that if a facility or program is to be established, it must be designed with community input from the start (to determine whether it’s for youth or adults, what programs it runs, etc.), rather than imposed top-down.

Crucially, **grassroots voices and smaller organisations** are rising in prominence. The Queenslanders with Disability Network (QDN) held a **Disability Community Forum in Mount Isa** in May 2024, in partnership with state agencies, to hear directly from people with disabilities and carers about service access in remote Queensland. Turnout was strong, and it provided a platform for residents to influence the state’s co-design of disability supports – particularly for children under 9 (a focus of the forum). Likewise, Indigenous elders have been forming local reference groups (such as a **Kalkadoon elders group** advising the Early Action Group mentioned earlier) to ensure programs respect cultural authority. There’s also a push to elevate **youth voices**: plans are underway for a Youth Council or reference group so young people can regularly meet with city leaders and inform decisions on recreation, safety, and jobs. The stories of individuals continue to inspire as well. For instance, a December 2024 ABC feature highlighted a Mount Isa beekeeper with disability who started a honey business and now mentors other NDIS participants in work skills – his story of resilience and inclusion struck a chord locally. Sharing such positive narratives (in local media or at events) helps counter the often negative image and shows what *can* be achieved with community support.

In summary, the trajectory in Mount Isa over the last year is one of **acknowledging hard truths** – inadequate housing, service gaps, youth crime – but also **harnessing local knowledge and energy** to drive change. Both government and community stakeholders seem to agree that solutions must be collaborative: combining funding and policy support from the top with authentic input and leadership from the ground. This spirit will guide the next steps as Mount Isa’s people write the next chapter for their region.

## Plan for a World-Class Regional Report – Methodology and Innovation

To build on this research and develop a *“world class”* regional report that truly serves Mount Isa’s community, we propose a multi-pronged approach. The report will not only catalogue services and issues (as we have done above), but also bring in **personal stories, data insights, and global best practices** to guide action. Below is a step-by-step plan outlining how to conduct a thorough services audit, engage the right people through interviews, and produce a compelling, high-impact report:

**1. Comprehensive Services Audit:** Begin by mapping *every relevant service* in the region across sectors – health, disability, education, justice, housing, family support, etc. This involves desktop research and outreach to compile an inventory of providers: government agencies (hospital, schools, Centrelink, Child Safety), non-profits (e.g. Centacare, NWQICSS, Salvation Army’s Serenity House), Indigenous organisations (e.g. Gurindal Aboriginal Corporation), and community groups (youth clubs, sports, churches). For each, gather key details: what programs they offer, capacity (staffing, beds or client numbers), eligibility, and any recent funding or cutbacks. **Local directories** and networks can aid this – for instance, the Mount Isa Community Directory and the Western QLD Primary Health Network lists are good starting points. We will also leverage any existing mapping (the *Mount Isa City Council* or DSDILGP may have a community services profile). The audit isn’t just a list – we will analyze **coverage and gaps**: e.g. noting if there’s no local disability respite provider, or if mental health services only cater to certain ages. Importantly, we will correlate services to the issues identified: are the highest-need problems (youth crime, housing, DV, etc.) matched by service availability? This gap analysis provides the evidence base for recommendations. The audit should be validated with local stakeholders – we’ll run it past the Mount Isa Interagency Network (if one exists) or a small reference group of service providers to ensure we didn’t miss anything and that it accurately reflects the on-the-ground reality.

**2. Stakeholder and Community Interviews:** A world-class report needs to capture the **voices of those on the frontlines and those affected**. We will conduct a structured series of interviews and community conversations. Key groups include: *Service managers* (e.g. the hospital CEO, police youth club officer, school principals, NGO program leaders) who can speak to capacity issues and initiatives; *Frontline workers* (nurses, youth case workers, social workers) who often have the best insight into day-to-day challenges; *Government representatives* (the Mayor and council community development staff, state MPs or public servants overseeing regional programs) for policy context and upcoming plans; and critically, *community members/clients* – such as families navigating the NDIS or youth justice, Indigenous elders involved in community groups, young people themselves (perhaps through a youth forum or school). We will use a semi-structured interview format tailored to each – for example, with agency leaders we might discuss performance data and resource needs, whereas with community members we’ll prompt them to share personal experiences (e.g. *“Tell me about a time you or someone you know needed help – what went well or what fell short?”*). To reach grassroots voices, we can partner with local networks – attending a meeting of the new QDN peer support group to hear from people with disabilities, or working with the Community Justice Group to host a yarning circle with Indigenous families. **Confidentiality and cultural sensitivity** will be paramount (engaging interpreters or Indigenous liaison as needed). These interviews will yield direct quotes and case studies for the report – putting a human face on statistics. As Corina James and Roslyn Von Senden’s story illustrated in the youth crime hearing, community members often pinpoint solutions outsiders miss. We will seek out such candid input, ensuring diverse representation (age, gender, cultural background) so the report reflects the *whole* community. Where possible, we’ll also record audio/video snippets (with consent) to potentially create companion multimedia content (e.g. short video interviews or an online audio story map).

**3. Quantitative Data Analysis:** Alongside qualitative insights, the report will be grounded in data. We will compile the latest available **statistics** on Mount Isa’s demographics and social outcomes: population trends, unemployment rates, youth offending rates, school attendance, hospital admission numbers, housing waitlist lengths, etc. Sources will include the Australian Bureau of Statistics (e.g. 2021 Census data for Mount Isa city and Gulf communities), Queensland Government open data portals (for crime stats, health KPIs, education outcomes), and any recent studies (like QCOSS or academic research on rural service access). For example, we’ll quantify the housing crisis by charting the 550-home shortfall from Council’s plan, or illustrate youth crime trends over 5–10 years to contextualize the 2024–25 improvements. Where available, comparisons to Queensland averages or similar regions will be included – to highlight what is unique to Mount Isa (e.g. twice the state suicide rate, or far higher rate of youth remand) and what systemic issues it shares with other rural areas (e.g. lack of GPs, allied health shortages). We will also incorporate any evaluation data from local programs – for instance, if PCYC or Youth Justice have metrics on how many youths were diverted from custody by a program, or how many NDIS participants gained jobs via a project like the beekeeping initiative. These hard numbers, presented in charts or infographics, will complement the interview findings and lend weight to the report’s recommendations. A **strengths-based lens** will be applied too: data on community assets (like volunteer rates, cultural events, youth participation in sport, etc.) can be featured to acknowledge positives and opportunities.

**4. Learning from Best Practices (Global & National):** As requested, we will research how similar community challenges have been addressed successfully elsewhere, to inspire “innovative thinking”. This involves a literature scan and possibly expert consultations. We’ll look at other remote or regional communities – in Australia and abroad – that have tackled issues like youth crime, Indigenous disadvantage, or service integration. For example, we might highlight the **Justice Reinvestment** approach used in Bourke, NSW (which dramatically reduced youth offending through community-led strategies), or a successful Indigenous-led health program in Canada or NZ. Internationally, there are pioneering methods in community engagement: one is the **GlobalGiving storytelling model** piloted in Kenya, where hundreds of local residents shared micro-narratives about what was helping or failing in their community, and these stories were systematically analyzed to guide funding. This not only surfaced grassroots solutions but also gave feedback to service providers in near-real-time, demonstrating the power of listening to beneficiary voices. We will draw lessons from such examples – e.g. how Kenya’s story project found unknown grassroots initiatives solving problems, or how a town in Scotland used “Participatory Budgeting” to let citizens allocate council funds to social projects. Another relevant framework is **Collective Impact**, used in some North American cities where multiple sectors form a common agenda to solve social problems (much like Mount Isa’s cross-sector forums). By including a section in our report on these “what’s worked elsewhere” case studies, we can spark ideas for Mount Isa. Importantly, each example will be tied back to local context: for instance, if we cite an early-intervention youth hub in New Zealand, we’ll note how Mount Isa’s Youth Hub (NWQICSS) could be expanded or funded to play a similar role. Innovative community storytelling techniques could be adopted too – maybe a local project to gather stories from youth or Elders which then inform policy (akin to a mini version of the SenseMaker approach used by Cognitive Edge, which combines narrative and data analysis). By researching these exemplars, we ensure our report doesn’t just catalogue problems but also **presents creative solutions and inspiration**, grounded in real-world success.

**5. Storytelling and Multimedia Integration:** To truly **bring the report to life**, we will use storytelling elements throughout the document. Rather than a dry technical report, it will read as a narrative of Mount Isa’s community. Each major section will open with a short story or vignette. For instance, the section on health might start with “John’s story” – a fictionalized but representative account of a Mount Isa resident traveling 900km for surgery – setting the stage for discussing health access. We’ll feature breakout boxes with *“Community Spotlight”* profiles: perhaps a youth worker who grew up in Mount Isa and is now mentoring kids (to illustrate local capacity), or a family who overcame challenges through a certain service. Real quotes from interviews will be highlighted in call-out bubbles for emphasis – e.g. an Elder’s plea *“We need services that our kids can trust”*, or a police officer’s observation *“We’re finally seeing fewer break-ins after midnight basketball started”*. These personal touches give authenticity and help stakeholders and readers (especially government officials who may read the report) emotionally connect with the community’s experiences. In terms of media, we will include **photographs** of local scenes and people (with permission). Images could include: a vibrant shot of youth at the PCYC boxing gym or on Country in a cultural program, a view of a neighborhood with both new and abandoned houses (to visually convey the housing paradox), and perhaps an uplifting image of a community event (e.g. the Isa Street Festival) to remind readers that Mount Isa is a proud, lively community not defined solely by its issues. Each photo will be captioned to tell a mini-story and credited appropriately. If possible, we’d love to include a short video or audio segment as a supplement (for digital distribution) – for example, a 2-minute montage of interview clips or a day-in-the-life segment at the Youth Hub. Even within the written report, we can use QR codes or links pointing to these multimedia pieces. By combining data and narrative in a visually engaging format, the final product will cater to a broad audience: **local residents (who should see their voices accurately reflected), service providers (who can use it for planning and funding advocacy), and government decision-makers (who will find clear evidence and community-driven recommendations).**

**6. Collaborative Review and Validation:** Before finalizing, we will circle back to the community with draft findings. This could mean hosting a validation workshop in Mount Isa – inviting those we interviewed and other stakeholders to hear a summary of insights and provide feedback or corrections. It’s a chance to check facts and also to ensure we correctly interpreted what we heard. It will also build local buy-in, making people feel *“this is our report”*. Additionally, this step can surface any last-minute ideas: for example, participants might prioritize the recommendations or suggest how to present them for impact. In our experience, this collaborative approach strengthens the credibility of the report. Given the earlier critique of outsiders “parachuting” in, being transparent and inclusive in the report-writing process itself demonstrates a better way of working. After incorporating feedback, we will finalize the report with an eye to clear, actionable conclusions.

**7. Clear Recommendations and Action Plan:** The final chapter will distill everything into a roadmap for action – likely a set of recommendations categorized by theme (e.g. **Housing**, **Health**, **Youth & Justice**, **Disability**). Each recommendation will be specific, evidence-backed, and assignable to an agency or partnership. For example: *“Establish a permanent Youth Services Hub (one-stop-shop) in Mount Isa, led by a local coalition, to coordinate activities of PCYC, YHARS, Youth Justice, etc. – Funding required: \$X (State government to consider under next budget) – Rationale: reduces duplication, extends service hours (as community noted need for after-hours presence).”* We will tie recommendations to our research (citing community quotes or data points that justify them) and where relevant, to the successful models from elsewhere (showing they are feasible). We’ll also include some “quick wins” alongside longer-term strategies, so that right after the report launch stakeholders can start implementing something. To keep momentum, an accompanying *Community Action Plan* can outline who will champion each item (perhaps the Mount Isa Council’s Community Development Committee or a new collective impact working group). Ultimately, the goal is that this report doesn’t sit on a shelf – it becomes a living blueprint for improving services and outcomes, with the community and government working in tandem.

**8. Innovative Presentation and Dissemination:** Lastly, how we deliver the report matters. We will ensure the final product is accessible and engaging. In addition to a traditional PDF, we might create an interactive webpage or dashboard with key findings (maps of service locations, charts that update with new data, video clips embedded). The launch event should be in Mount Isa with community members co-presenting the findings alongside authors – embodying the partnership ethos. We will also provide an *Easy Read* summary or infographic version, so that people with low literacy or busy readers can grasp the highlights quickly. Since the user specifically mentioned interest in **video storytelling**, we could produce a short documentary-style video (\~5-7 minutes) featuring interviews and local footage to accompany the report, which can be shared on social media and at meetings to spark discussion. By using these creative formats, we cater to different audiences – from elders who prefer face-to-face yarning, to youth who might engage more with a video on Facebook, to officials in Brisbane who will appreciate a crisp policy brief.

In implementing this plan, we draw on how other communities have succeeded. A recurring theme in global best practice is *amplifying local voices* and turning those stories into action. As one development expert noted, *“Gathering heartwarming stories for their emotional appeal is not the aim… it’s about creating an organized mass of information that helps everyone – from donors to beneficiaries – make better decisions about what gets funded and done”*. In Mount Isa, this means coupling the powerful anecdotes we hear with solid analysis so that funders and governments can’t ignore the message. By auditing services, listening deeply to the community, and embracing innovative storytelling, our report will serve as a **catalyst for change** – lighting the path toward a healthier, safer, and more inclusive Mount Isa region.
