# 🎯 Updated Scraping Strategy - Following How_to_scrape.md Methodology

## ✅ **Key Improvements Based on Your Documentation**

After reviewing your comprehensive `How_to_scrape.md` strategy, here are the critical improvements we need to implement:

---

## 🏆 **PHASE 1: STRUCTURED DATA SOURCES (Highest Priority)**

### **1. My Community Directory - Mount Isa**
```javascript
// PRIMARY TARGET: Council-endorsed local directory
// URL: https://www.mycommunitydirectory.com.au/Queensland/Mount_Isa
// Strategy: Direct scraping of structured listings
// Expected: 50-100 local services with complete contact info
```

**Why prioritize this:**
- ✅ **Council-endorsed** (Mount Isa City Council supports this)
- ✅ **Structured data** (consistent format)  
- ✅ **High credibility** (official local directory)
- ✅ **Complete information** (addresses, phones, emails)

### **2. Ask Izzy (Infoxchange API)**
```javascript
// API ACCESS: Australia's largest services directory (450k+ listings)
// Strategy: Query API for Mount Isa services if accessible
// Fallback: Public search scraping with proper attribution
// Expected: 100-200 services across all categories
```

**Implementation:**
- Try API access first (most ethical)
- Fallback to respectful public scraping
- Always credit Infoxchange as source

### **3. OnePlace Community Services Directory**
```javascript
// GOVERNMENT SOURCE: 58,000+ support services across Queensland
// URL: https://www.qfcc.qld.gov.au/services/oneplace
// Strategy: Search for Mount Isa region services
// Expected: 30-50 government-funded services
```

---

## 🏛️ **PHASE 2: GOVERNMENT OPEN DATA PORTALS**

### **Queensland Government Open Data**
```bash
# Search data.qld.gov.au for:
# - Community services datasets
# - Health facilities data  
# - Youth services lists
# - CSV/JSON downloads when available

# Example searches:
# "Mount Isa community services filetype:csv"
# "North West Queensland health services"
```

### **National Health Services Directory (NHSD)**
```javascript
// ACCESS: Comprehensive health services dataset
// Strategy: Query for Mount Isa health services
// Expected: 20-30 official health services
```

## 🤝 **PHASE 3: NGO AND COMMUNITY DIRECTORIES**

### **Specialized Directories:**
- Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council
- Youth Affairs Network Queensland  
- Queensland Disability Network
- Legal Aid Queensland service locator

---

## 📈 **EXPECTED SCALING RESULTS**

### **Following Structured Approach:**
- **Phase 1**: 150-300 services (high-quality, official sources)
- **Phase 2**: 50-100 additional services (government data)
- **Phase 3**: 30-80 specialized services (NGO directories)
- **Total Expected**: **230-480 Mount Isa services**

### **Quality Improvements:**
- 🎯 **95%+ credibility** (official sources)
- ✅ **Complete contact information**
- ✅ **Proper attribution and licensing**
- ✅ **Ethical data collection**
- ✅ **Legally compliant**

---

## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Respectful Crawling**
```javascript
// Implement proper delays
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));

// Rotate user agents  
'User-Agent': 'MountIsaServiceMap/1.0 (Community Service Directory)'

// Check robots.txt first
// Implement rate limiting
// Use structured data when available
```

### **2. Data Attribution**
```javascript
const metadata = {
    source_name: 'My Community Directory',
    credibility: 'high',
    license: 'public_directory',
    attribution_required: true,
    ethical_compliance: 'full'
};
```

### **3. Legal Compliance**
- ✅ **Public data only** (no login-required content)
- ✅ **Proper attribution** to all sources
- ✅ **Respect robots.txt** guidelines
- ✅ **Rate limiting** to avoid overloading servers
- ✅ **Focus on community benefit** (not commercial exploitation)

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Run Structured Data Strategy**
```bash
# Execute the new structured approach
node structured-data-strategy.js

# Expected: 50-150 high-quality services in first run
```

### **Step 2: Government Data Mining**  
```bash
# Search and download available datasets
# Focus on Queensland government portals
# Import CSV/JSON files directly when available
```

### **Step 3: API Integration**
```bash
# Contact Ask Izzy/Infoxchange for API access
# Explore NHSD API possibilities
# Request partnerships with directories
```

## 🎯 **BOTTOM LINE**

**Your How_to_scrape.md strategy is superior to our current approach.** Here's why:

### **Current Approach Issues:**
- ❌ Raw web scraping first
- ❌ API rate limiting issues  
- ❌ Lower data quality
- ❌ Potential ethical concerns

### **Updated Approach Benefits:**
- ✅ **Official directories first**
- ✅ **API integration priority**
- ✅ **Higher quality data**
- ✅ **Ethical and legal compliance**
- ✅ **Sustainable scaling**

**Let's implement the structured data strategy immediately.** This will likely discover 200-400 Mount Isa services with higher quality and credibility than our current 14 services.

The new approach follows your excellent methodology: **"find and use the richest existing data sources, fill gaps with targeted crawling, store everything in a structured database with geospatial capability, and stay on the right side of legal/ethical lines."**
