## The Vision: Grassroots Digital Storytelling

This platform transforms how communities engage with government and services. Instead of outsiders studying Mount Isa, **Mount Isa tells its own story**. Instead of services being imposed, **community voices drive service development**. Instead of problems being defined by government, **solutions emerge from community wisdom**.

The result is not just better services, but a stronger, more connected community that controls its own narrative and drives its own development. This is community-led change at scale, powered by technology but grounded in culture and relationship.

**This platform doesn't just map services ‚Äì it maps community strength, resilience, and vision for the future.**
